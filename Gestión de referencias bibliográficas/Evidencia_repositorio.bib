	abstract = {No science has ever been done without a sustained and far-reaching imaginative effort. The images, myths, and patterns of ideas become, in due time, sedimented into coherent discourse, formulae, golden rules of work—in brief, what we identify as normal science. The naive picture of science as the steady, linear accumulation of true propositions by the sheer weight of empirical evidence is most certainly false and gone with the nineteenth century. Indeed, the main outcome of the modern field of the history of science has been to settle that issue once and for all, starting with the work of Alexandre Koyre, and later followed by the widely read The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas Kuhn. These historians of science, among many others, had the great merit of actually looking into the rich flows of the establishment of a concept in a particular discipline. Koyre dealt with the process of the origins of mechanics and Galileo’s physics. 8A more recent study has addressed, for instance, the emergence of immunology during Pasteur’s time, in all its sociological complexity. 9The message from these investigations has become unavoidable for all but the most recalcitrant empiricists: science is never done without an indissoluble link between theory and fact. Facts are made by the theoretical spectacles one puts 2on (the expression is Kuhn’s) just as much as theory is shaped by the results of empirical observations. © 1993 by Taylor \& Francis Group LLC.},

It is proposed that the significance of such retinal regional specialization, in comparison to similar studies in the pigeon and the chick, is that regional specialization in the avian retina is more closely related to feeding habits than to phylogenetic descendence.},

	abstract = {The costs of spare parts represent an important share of the operation and maintenance costs of capital goods. Spare parts may remain in depots and warehouses for long periods of time, and, many of them require logistics activities. There are several life-cycle cost estimation models for capital-intensive production systems however, commonly, they do not consider logistics costs adequately. Thus, to incorporate all these aspects into the computation of the cost of ownership of spare parts, a time-driven activity-based costing model is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, since the dynamics of spare parts management are based on the reliability of the components, the Weibull’s function is integrated into the model. An application is presented considering a logistics distribution center. The presented approach allowed the costs estimation besides the idle capacity estimation, two important information inputs in logistics management. The results show the usefulness of the proposed model. The opportunities for further research and applications are also discussed.},

The process includes a random forest procedure to identify the strongest precursors of accidents, and the calibration/estimation of two classification models, namely, Support Vector Machine and Logistic regression. We find that, for this stretch of the highway, vehicle composition does not play a first-order role. Our best model accurately predicts 67.89\% of the accidents with a low false positive rate of 20.94\%. These results are among the best in the literature even though, and as opposed to previous efforts, (i) we do not use only one partition of the data set for calibration and validation but conduct 300 repetitions of randomly selected partitions; (ii) our models are validated on the original unbalanced data set (where accidents are quite rare events), rather than on artificially balanced data.},

Thus, little effort has been made to quantify the impact of flow composition variables as crash precursors. We analyze the advantages of having access to this data by analyzing two scenarios, namely, with aggregated and disaggregated data. For each case, we build Logistics Regressions and Support Vector Machines models to predict accidents in a major urban expressway in Santiago, Chile. Our results show that having access to disaggregated data by vehicle type increases the prediction power up to 30 \% providing, at the same time, much better intuition about the actual traffic conditions that may lead to accidents. These results may be useful when evaluating technology investments and developments in urban freeways.},

	abstract = {The concept of life cycle sustainability assessment provides an interdisciplinary space to discuss the main challenges in addressing sustainability from a long-term perspective. However, uncertainty related to cost parameters constitutes one of the main challenges in LCC. This uncertainty prevents managers from precisely anticipating the exact values of important variables. These variables include the costs of spare parts inventories, which in some cases can constitute high percentages of the total cost of a product or service. We propose an activity-based costing model that handles uncertainty using triangular numbers, along with a matrix representation, and Weibull functions to incorporate the projected equipment reliability into the model. A case study based on a spare parts distribution center, which serves the mining industry in Northern Chile, is presented. The results obtained are compared with a traditional costing method. The advantage of using the proposed approach over the traditional one is evident. Future research is directed towards the implementation of a larger number of inventory policies, along with experimentation with other types of fuzzy numbers.},

	abstract = {This article proposes an activity-based costing decision model that considers the life cycle of physical assets particularly, the logistics costs of non-repairable spare parts. The Weibull based failure rate behavior along the life cycle is considered to have a more realistic representation of the demand and a more accurate computation of the logistics costs associated with the different types of spare parts. Thus, through the use of this model it is possible to evaluate different inventory policies and their respective parameters in order to define efficient long-term inventory policies. Also, it represents a decision-making tool for assessing the effects of the different failure rates of each critical spare part. Finally, it can be used as an optimization tool for supporting the design of logistics policies namely, in terms of stock and service levels, and costs. The activity-based life-cycle costing (AB-LCC) model proposed here mitigates limitations of both activity-based costing (ABC) and life-cycle costing (LCC) approaches through a novel combination of these concepts. Theoretical and managerial contributions and several applications and extensions of the AB-LCC model are expected as it is discussed at the end of the article. Specifically, the model presented here is a valuable tool for maintainers to manage critical non-repairable spare parts inventories.},

	abstract = {Natural gas gained significant attention due to its low carbon emissions and competitive prices in North America relative to other energy sources. The Annual Energy Outlook 2015 projects the U.S. as a net exporter by 2017. Recently, Mexico launched its energy reform, aiming to expand domestic production by opening the market to private investors. The success or failure of these policy changes will impact the development of the natural gas market in North America. To analyze possible pathways of the Mexican energy reform, we develop the North American Natural Gas Model (NANGAM). NANGAM is a long-term partial equilibrium model that allows for endogenous infrastructure expansion and non-linear cost functions. NANGAM is calibrated using the most recent data available from U.S., Canadian, and Mexican sources. We find that, in order to reduce pipeline imports, Mexico depends on economic incentives that lower barriers to infrastructure investment and keep production costs at competitive levels. If reforms to guarantee these incentives are not successfully implemented, growing gas demand in Mexico will be satisfied by further supply from Texas and neighboring states. This will cause a ripple-effect of increasing production in other regions in the U.S. and a shift in trade flows across the continent.},

	abstract = {Economic models are needed to analyze the impact of policies adopted for controlling carbon emissions and increasing distributed renewable generation in microgrids (green penetration). The impacts are manifested in performance measures like emissions, electricity prices, and electricity consumption. This paper presents an economic model comprising bi-level optimization and Pareto analysis. In the bi-level framework, the upper level models the operation of the microgrids and the lower level deals with electricity dispatch in the grid. The economic model is applied on a sample network in two steps. In step1, the bi-level model yields operational strategies for the microgrids and the corresponding values of the grid performance measures. In step2, a statistical analysis of variance combined with Pareto optimization attains guidelines for setting policies for emissions reduction and green penetration without adversely impacting electricity prices and demand. We conclude that renewable generation from microgrids can significantly reduce the negative impacts of the policies. Our economic model is novel as it 1) integrates operational strategies of microgrids and the grid under an emissions control regime, 2) explicitly considers social cost of carbon in the electricity dispatch, and 3) balances multiple objectives of emissions reduction, green penetration, and electricity consumption using a Pareto analysis.},

The bottom layer finds, for a given C\&T policy, equilibrium bidding strategies of the competing generators while maximizing social welfare via a DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) model. We refer to this layer as policy evaluation. The top layer (called policy optimization) involves design of Pareto optimal C\&T policies over a planning horizon. The performance measures that are considered for the purpose of design are social welfare and the corresponding system marginal price (MP), CO2 emissions, and electricity consumption level.},

	abstract = {Despite significant progress made by China in liberalizing its natural gas market, certain key areas such as market access and pricing mechanisms remain controlled by the government. To assess how such distortions impact the market, we have developed a Mixed Complementarity Problem model of China's natural gas industry, with a novel representation of price caps associated with supply obligations. The model is used to assess how government pricing policies and restricted third party access to midstream infrastructure impacted the supply logistics of China's profit maximizing natural gas firms in the year 2015. We find that lifting the price caps for regulated natural gas demand sectors could yield a 4.7\% (1.4 billion USD) reduction in total system cost and reduce the national average of marginal supply costs by 14\%. Improving third party access to the pipeline and regasification infrastructure would result in an additive total cost saving of 7.6\% (2.2 billion USD) and a 16\% reduction in average prices, due to replacing domestic and imported LNG with pipeline imports. The LNG industry would be negatively affected by the reforms investigated in this study, as market players would gain more flexibility in their logistics and would utilize lower cost supply pathways.},
